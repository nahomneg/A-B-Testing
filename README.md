# A-B-Testing
This repository is used for week 4 challenge of 10Academy.
The objective of this project is to determine if the creativity and interactivity of ads had an impact on brand awareness.

I used three approaches
* Classical AB test ( AB-Test.ipynb )
* Sequential AB test ( Sequential.ipynb ) 
* Machine Learning based aproach ( ML_BASED-Final )

## Results
All three approaches showed that no significant conclusion that the
interactive ads performed better than the dummy ones can be made from the
given dataset.

## Limitations
The main problem with the analysis was the low sample size. The problem
wasnâ€™t a result of low traffic but rather low engagement from users. The
dataset had more than 8000 records but only just over a 1000 were used.This
is a result of users not having enough incentives to answer the questions.
